<p>Hello, <ins><b>my</b></ins> name is Josh Aldwyn A. Duigan <img src="IMG_20241116_154926.jpg" alt="me"
width="120px" height="150px">, 14 years old from 9-GomBurZa, studying at Lakand Dula Highschool. What <b><ins>i</b></ins> do when <b><ins>I'm</b></ins> sad, bored or when <b><ins>i</b></ins>  have extra time is <mark><ins>drawing/playing with friends because it makes <ins><b>me</b></ins>  happy. Other things that makes <b><ins>me</b></ins>  happy are newly bought things, or expensive things that can be useful at times</mark></ins>. <b><ins>My</b></ins> life motto is <mark><ins>"Perception comes from forgiveness"</ins></mark> that <b><ins>i</b></ins>  rephrased from and originally known as <ins><blockquote><em><big>"To know one, Is to forgive one"</big></blockquote></ins></em></p>

<p><ins><b>My</b></ins> family members are: <big>Mark Selwyn A. Duigan</big>, being <ins><b>my</ins></b> sibling or older brother, <big>Maria Cecilia A. Duigan</big> and <big>Jose Ni√±o A. Duigan</big>, being <b><ins><b>my</b></b></ins> <em>parents</em>.</p>

<p>The utmost <b>experiences</b> <ins><b>i</b></ins> would like to tell as part of <ins><b>my</b></ins>  introduction, is when <ins><b>i</b></ins>  was in a <ins><mark>near death</mark> situation but <b><ins>i</b></ins>  was <code>saved</code>. <b><ins>I</b></ins>  don't remember the details clearly but <ins><b>i</b></ins>  was in a place that day, <ins><b>i</b></ins>  was doing some random stuff at streets, playing, running and doing all that, <b><ins>i</b></ins>  was wandering through the crowd with my friends and <b><ins>i</b></ins>  was totally full of joy. <b><ins>My</ins></b>  mind was not paying attention about the place, <b><ins>it</ins></b>  was paying attention to the joy that <b><ins>i</ins></b>  was having, full of <i><b>excitement, energy and very hyper</b></i>. To the point that, <b><ins>i</ins></b>  would not notice a motor that has no brake, and in simple terms, uncontrollable. <b><ins>It</ins></b>  did not have the best steering either, so the <b><ins>motorist</ins></b>  cannot really do anything about <b><ins>it</ins></b>, because if <b><ins>he</ins></b>  jumps off <b><ins>he</ins></b> will still hold the accountability of the destructions that were done. (112) But that is not the most shocking thing, yet. As <b><ins>you</b></ins> have guessed, the <b><ins>motor</b></ins> was headed right literally where <b><ins>i</b></ins> was running and frolicking around, as <b><ins>it</b></ins> gets closer, <b><ins>i</b></ins> start to notice <b><ins>it</b></ins>, and <b><ins>i</b></ins> was scared as hell. But luckily, <mark>someone had the ability to think <del>fast</del>quickly in that very particular situation and pulled me, opposing the direction of <b><ins>his</b></ins> <b><ins>motorbike</b></ins></mark>, with no wounds, no scratches, or anything.</p>


<p>For <b><ins>me</b></ins>, the most challenging experience that <b><ins>I</b></ins> have had so far are <mark>the experiences throughout this high school journey</mark>. <b><ins>I</b></ins> have always had problems with <b><ins>my</b></ins> social life, to the point that <b><ins>it</b></ins> affects <b><ins>my</b></ins> academics in any sort of way, either positive, or negative. <b><ins>I</b></ins> am very sensitive when <b><ins>it</b></ins> comes to words, actions and things that make <b><ins>me</b></ins> question <b><ins>my</b></ins> own worth, especially offensive words that <b><ins>i</b></ins> have received from <b><ins>my</b></ins> so called "<em>friends</em>". <mark>Friendships and other kinds of relationships hardly affected <b><ins>my</b></ins> mental state</mark> and how <b><ins>my</b></ins> <em>brain processes things</em>. <b><ins>I</b></ins> always felt like <b><ins>i</b></ins> was misunderstood and not even <sup>10</sup> <u>self explanatory</u> words will make <b><ins>them</b></ins> understand my situation. But what <b><ins>i</b></ins> did is that <b><ins>i</b></ins> didn't <b>give up</b>, <b><ins>i</b></ins> kept <mark>fighting and fighting</mark> until <b><ins>I've</b></ins> finally done good. <b><ins>I</b></ins> let go of the people who were not being so sensitive, and then kept those people who supported <b><ins>me</b></ins> at <b><ins>my</b></ins> lowest.</p>

<p  style="color:red;font-size:5mm;"> <b><ins>I'd</b></ins> like to tell <b><ins>you</b></ins> about how <b><ins>my</b></ins> values changed over the years.<small><b><ins>I</b></ins> slowly adapt to <b><ins>my</b></ins> surroundings and focused on what needed change, because <b><ins>i</b></ins> want to be the person <b><ins>I've</b></ins> been dreaming of, manners filling <b><ins>my</b></ins> personality, discipline, patience and simplicity. <b><ins>I've</b></ins> learnt to settle and adapt to the things that makes me uncomfortable, or practicing voluntary discomfort, based in stoic practices</small>. The introduction wouldn't be complete without me saying <b><ins>my</b></ins> favourite things. <b><ins>My</b></ins> favourite things are things that are color black, like accessories, clothes and etc. I like spicy foods such as ramens,<img src="Messenger_creation_9EFEB269-190D-407E-869E-6DD32DA1E198.heic" alt="ramens" width="136" height="148px"> chickens <img src="IMG_20241012_151423.jpg" alt="chickens" width="150px" height="200px"> and specific sweet foods and drinks such as puto bumbong <center><img src="IMG_20241113_213858.jpg" alt="putobumbong" width="150px" height="200px"</center>, and softdrinks<img src="IMG_20241130_155830.jpg" alt="softdrinks" width="150px" height="200px">
I also love spending time with my friends and family, it calms me and ease my heavy feelings when they are around, there's nothing as enjoyable as spending time with them, for all we have is laughter, understanding and mostly quality time. </p>

<p>And finally, <b><ins>my</b></ins> plans for the future are: <mark><ins>manage a business, start a family, and travel around the world<mark><u>, but first <sub><b><ins>i</b></ins> want to study really hard</sub>, because if <b><ins>i</b></ins> don't, <b><ins>i</b></ins> wouldn't get a good future and would not be able to do things <b><ins>i</b></ins> want to do </p>
